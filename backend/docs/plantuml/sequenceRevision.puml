    query sequence that will be revised

    alt highest version of sequenceID with Status 'SILO_READY' exists
        backend -> DB: insert new version in status 'RECEIVED'
    backend -> frontend: response with sequenceId + new version number
    else sequenceID with Status 'SILO_READY' does not exist
        backend -> frontend: response with error message
    end
